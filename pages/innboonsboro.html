            <p>The inn is owned by no other than Maryland resident and New York Times best selling author, Nora Roberts.
                You may have also read her work under the pseudonym J.D. Robb, from the in Death series.</P>
            <p>Old records suggest that the building dates back to the 1790s. After being abandoned for some time, Nora
                Roberts purchased and renovated the structure. It wasn't easy getting to opening day, as a fire
                tragically burnt most of the building. After much work from local contractors, Inn Boonsboro finally
                opened in February 2009.</p>
            <p>One of the most intriguing details of this boutique hotel is that it's literary-themed. All rooms are
                based on the love story and era from iconic storybook characters.</p>
            <p>There are 8 rooms total, all unique in their own way.</p>
