      Nora Roberts, (born October 10, 1950, Silver Spring, Maryland, U.S.), American romance novelist who was one of
        the
        most successful and prolific authors of the genre.

        As a child, Roberts was an avid reader and frequently formulated her own stories. After graduating from high
        school,
        she married and later had two sons. Confined to her home with her young children during a blizzard in 1979, she
        penned
        her first novel, Irish Thoroughbred (1981). Following that debut, Roberts enjoyed phenomenal success with dozens
        of
        enthralling romance novels. Atypical of the genre, her works did not focus on glamour and money but instead
        featured
        characters that were relatable to readers. In 1995 she began writing romance-crime novels, which were released
        under
        the pseudonym J.D. Robb; her first book in the genre was Naked in Death. Extremely prolific, Roberts followed a
        very
        disciplined schedule of writing up to eight hours, five days per week. She sometimes finished a dozen
        publications
        annually, and in 2012 she released her 200th book, The Witness. Roberts’s novels were translated into more than
        25
        languages and consistently topped the best-seller lists. By the early 21st century, more than 400 million copies
        of
        her books were in print. Many, such as Sanctuary (1997), The Reef (1998), and Midnight Bayou (2001), were
        adapted as
        made-for-television movies.

        Roberts was the first inductee (1986) into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame and, for her 100th novel,
        Montana Sky (1996), the first recipient of its Centennial Award. Roberts also received lifetime achievement
        awards
        from the Romance Writers of America.
