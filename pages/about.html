      Nora Roberts, (born October 10, 1950, Silver Spring, Maryland, U.S.), American romance novelist who was one of
      the
      most successful and prolific authors of the genre.
      <br>
      <br>
      As a child, Roberts was an avid reader and frequently formulated her own stories. After graduating from high
      school,
      she married and later had two sons. Confined to her home with her young children during a blizzard in 1979, she
      penned
      her first novel, Irish Thoroughbred (1981). Following that debut, Roberts enjoyed phenomenal success with dozens
      of
      enthralling romance novels. Atypical of the genre, her works did not focus on glamour and money but instead
      featured
      characters that were relatable to readers. In 1995 she began writing romance-crime novels, which were released
      under
      the pseudonym J.D. Robb; her first book in the genre was Naked in Death. Extremely prolific, Roberts followed a
      very
      disciplined schedule of writing up to eight hours, five days per week. She sometimes finished a dozen
      publications
      annually, and in 2012 she released her 200th book, The Witness. Roberts’s novels were translated into more than
      25
      languages and consistently topped the best-seller lists. By the early 21st century, more than 400 million copies
      of
      her books were in print. Many, such as Sanctuary (1997), The Reef (1998), and Midnight Bayou (2001), were
      adapted as
      made-for-television movies.

      Roberts was the first inductee (1986) into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame and, for her 100th novel,
      Montana Sky (1996), the first recipient of its Centennial Award. Roberts also received lifetime achievement
      awards
      from the Romance Writers of America.
